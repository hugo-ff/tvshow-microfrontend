## Introduction

Welcome! This project consists of three thrilling microfrontends: the Host 🏠, the Harry Potter Characters Listing ⚡, and the Rick and Morty Characters Listing 👽. Get ready for a magical and interdimensional adventure as you explore the world of your favorite characters.

## Microfrontend Architecture

To achieve the microfrontend architecture, the powerful Module Federation feature of Webpack 5 was utilized. Each microfrontend is entirely independent and must be started separately to enjoy all its wonders.

## Quick Start

Follow these simple steps to start each microfrontend:

```bash
# To start all microfrontends simultaneously, follow these steps:

# 1. Navigate to each microfrontend folder.
cd microfrontend-folder

# 2. Install the dependencies.
yarn install

# 3. Start all microfrontends.
yarn serve
```

That's it! Now you can enjoy the magic of each microfrontend.

## Internationalization

This app offers internationalization so you can enjoy the adventure in both English and Spanish. Don't forget to use the fun language switch! 🌍🗺️

## Testing and Styling

Each microfrontend includes comprehensive testing using Jest and React Testing Library. Styles are created using Styled-Components, following the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology. The component architecture is based on Atomic Design, which facilitates maintenance and scalability.

## Design and Architecture

To ensure scalability, we apply Hexagonal Architecture and Vertical Slicing, following SOLID principles and leveraging design patterns such as Singleton, Object Mother, Repository, Adapter, and Decorator 🛠️.
